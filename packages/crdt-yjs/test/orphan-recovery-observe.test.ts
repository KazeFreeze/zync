/**
 * S7 — orphan-recovery-after-observe-collision
 *
 * Proves that after a genuine offline→connected heal, the LWW-loser orphan is
 * recovered to a deterministic conflict artifact via a FULL pass' orphan sweep
 * (runFullConvergencePass → runOrphanSweep).
 *
 * Collision setup:
 *   A and B each create the SAME vault path while partitioned (A offline), then
 *   heal via a.transport.goOnline(). The index tree LWW binds the path to one
 *   winner docId; the LOSER docId remains in the loser device's docStore as an
 *   orphan.
 *
 * Recovery path: on reconnect, pending is still non-empty (the loser docId is
 * still dirty), so the pending-gated reconnect self-heal arms and runs a full
 * pass (structuralReconcile → runOrphanSweep) — recovering the loser AT/BY the
 * reconnect. Belt-and-suspenders: the later S6c quiescence audit runs the SAME
 * orphan sweep, so whichever fires, the outcome holds. This test therefore
 * asserts OUTCOMES, not the recovery SCHEDULE:
 *   - at least one conflict artifact surfaces across the two engines;
 *   - the loser is recovered EXACTLY once per device (no duplicate artifacts);
 *   - every recovered path is a deterministic "(conflict, …)" artifact;
 *   - the winning content is intact (no loss).
 *
 * The reconnect self-heal jitter is set to 0 (reconnectHealJitterMaxMs) so the
 * arm fires immediately — required for a clean fake-timer test.
 *
 * Load-bearing: the test fails if runOrphanSweep is removed from the full path
 * entirely (the recovered assertion would fail — no conflict artifact appears),
 * confirming the sweep is genuinely load-bearing in full passes.
